## Documentation

I have created a Tic Tac Toe game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project not only honed my web development skills but also deepened my understanding of game logic and user interaction. By working on this project, I improved my proficiency in DOM manipulation, event handling, and responsive design.

Developing the game was a rewarding experience, and it inspired me to tackle more complex projects in the future. I am eager to continue building interactive and engaging web applications, leveraging the skills and knowledge I gained from this project.
